# gif-it-good: Art on Repeat
_Created as part of the Northwestern Coding Boot Camp curriculum_

Art on Repeat is a tool for viewing gifs of artists available through the GIPHY API.

View it here: (https://artonrepeat.herokuapp.com)

Upon load, the page is populated with a list of buttons and an entry form. When the user presses on a button, a search is made to the giphy API for that subject, and a gallery of relevant still gifs is added to the screen with information on the rating of each gif. The user can click on a gif to animate, and click again to freeze.

Pressing another button reloads the gallery with gifs relevant to the new topic.

Putting a term in the search bar will load another button into the list that behaves like the other buttons.
