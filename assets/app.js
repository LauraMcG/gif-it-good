// Upon load, the page will be populated with a list of buttons, a blank main area, and a side panel with a submission form.

// When the user presses on a button, a gallery of relevant still gifs load, with info on the rating of each gif.

// The user can click on a gif to animate, and click again to freeze.

// Pressing another button reloads the gallery with gifs relevant to the new topic.

// Putting a term in the search bar will load another button into the list. It will behave like the other buttons.
